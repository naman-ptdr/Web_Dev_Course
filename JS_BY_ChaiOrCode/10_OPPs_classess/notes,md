Do javascript really have classes?

Yes , JS does have classes. THis fesature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015 specification (often referred to as Es ).
Hovever, its important to note that JS is primarilly a Prototype - based language, and its classes are primarily syntatic 
sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms.
In other words it provides a more familier syntax for devlopers coming from class- based lang. such as java and c++, but under the hood , it works somewhat differently.
